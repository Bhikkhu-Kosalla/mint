# **Introduction to Thematic Units**(*Vākya & Vākyajotaka*)
## **Introduction**
There are two kinds of relations usually defined to analyze given Pali text, namely, *word-to-word* relations and *sentence-to-sentence* ones. The former is used to get the syntactic sense of a sentence and has been discussed in *Basic / Advanced Relational Grammar*. The latter is used to get the accurate picture of logical relations among sentences of a paragraph, a chapter or even a volume. This topic is an introduction to *sentence-to-sentence* relations.
## **Thematic Unit** (*Vākya*)
The Pali term *vākya* literally means "a sentence", i.e., a self-contained set of words, in which syntactic word-to-word relations can be properly defined without going out of the set. However, it means here an independent unit of content or subject matter, hence the term **thematic unit**. The **smallest thematic unit** is a **sentence** and each of them may combine to form larger ones --- with their extents ranging from **two or more sentences** up to **a whole paragraph or chapter**, or **even a whole volume**.
## **Thematic Markers** (*Vākyajotaka*s)
Many thematic units are marked by certain indeclinables, namely, *hi, ca,* or *pana*. They are usually placed **immediately after** the **initial words** of their respective sentences. In theory, they are similar to English conjunctions --- they are said to illuminate the thematic relations among *thematic units*. In practice, however, each of them is used to indicate almost all relations possible; it is almost impossible to rely on them when they are so overloaded.

The actual process is rather the reverse. A thematic marker is only a signal that indicates the necessity to analyze the thematic relation of its HOST unit to the PREVIOUS one. After the analysis has been finished and the relation found out, that relation is used to make a reasonable translation of the marker itself.
## **Essential Content** (*Piṇḍattha*)
The term **essential content** is used in contrast with the *literal* content.

For example, a simple sentence counting the Triple Gems as Buddha, Dhamma and Saṅgha is **literally different** from a whole chapter explaining them in detail one by one; but they are **essentially the same** in content. Why? Because the subject matter is the same, i.e., the Triple Gems.

The **essential content** of a thematic unit is related to that of its **previous** or **following one** in one of following three ways:
- a. Identity
- b. Cause / effect (premise / conclusion)
- c. ordinary connection.

## **Types of Thematic Units**
The type of a given **thematic unit** is defined in reference to its preceding and following ones. For instance, if a unit is an **elaboration** of the previous one but serves as one of **partial content** to the following one, it is termed as the unit of both elaboration and **partial content**. Accordingly, types of thematic units are usually given in pairs; in each pair, each member has its type defined in reference to another.

Depending on the relation of their **essential contents**, they are divided into three classes.

- A. Units of Identical Contents

  1. Unit of [Summarized Content](# "saṅkhepa vākya") followed by Unit of [Elaborated Content](# "vitthāra vākya")
  2. Unit of [Elaborated Content](# "vitthāra vākya") followed by Unit of [Summarized Content](# "saṅkhepa vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  3. Unit of [Vague Content](# "apākaṭa vākya") followed by Unit of [Illuminated Content](# "tappākaṭīkaraṇa vākya")
  4. Unit of [Doubtful Content](# "daḷhiya vākya待定") followed by Unit of [Confirming Content](# "daḷhīkaraṇa vākya确定")
  5. Unit of [Main Content](# "nigamanīya vākya") followed by Unit of [Concluding Content](# "nigamana vākya")
- B. Units of Cause and Effect
 
  1. Unit of [Premise (Cause)](# "kāraṇa vākya") followed by Unit of [Conclusion (Effect)](# "phala vākya")
  2. Unit of [Conclusion (Effect)](# "phala vākya") followed by Unit of [Premise (Cause)](# "kāraṇa vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  3. Unit of [Confirmable Content](# "yutti vākya") followed by Unit of [Convincing Implication](# "laddhaguṇa vākya")
  4. Unit of [Disputable Content](# "ayutti vākya") followed by Unit of [Destructive Implication](# "laddhadosa vākya")
- C. Units of Ordinary Connection

  1.   Unit of [Partial Content](# "āraddha vākya") followed by Unit of [Continued Supplement](# "upanyāsa vākya")
  2.   Unit of [Partial Content](# "āraddha vākya") followed by Unit of [Resumed Supplement](# "vākyārambha vākya")
  3.   Unit of [General Content](# "sāmañña vākya") followed by Unit of [Particular Content](# "visesa vākya")
  4.   Unit of [Particular Content](# "visesa vākya") followed by Unit of [General Content](# "sāmañña vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  5.  Unit of [Affirmative Content](# "anvaya vākya") followed by Unit of [Negative Content](# "byatireka vākya")
  6.  Unit of [Negative Content](# "byatireka vākya") followed by Unit of [Affirmative Content](# "anvaya vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  7.  Unit of [Disapproved Content](# "garahā vākya") followed by Unit of [Commended Content](# "sambhāvanā vākya")
  8.  Unit of [Commended Content](# "sambhāvanā vākya") followed by Unit of [Disapproved Content](# "garahā vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  9.  Unit of [Previous Theme](# "pakkha vākya") followed by Unit of [Next Theme](# "pakkhantara vākya")

## **Usage of Thematic Markers**
1. All three markers, i.e., *hi*, *ca*, *pana*, can be placed in the **respective subsequent units** of all pairs **except the last three** to illuminate the relation of the **host** unit to the **previous** one.
2. Only *pana* can be used with the **subsequent** units of the **last three**, that is, with those of the 16th, 17th, and 18th.

## **Examples and Explanations of Thematic Units**
**Note:** In each example below, a potential thematic marker is marked as (**T.M**) and placed as the second word in the subsequent unit. And its translation is also given.

## 1. [**Unit of Summarized Content** *followed by* **Unit of Elaborated Content**](# "saṅkhepavākya - vitthāravākya")

E.g.

1. 
   - A. The couple lived at Sarnath.
   - B. Sarnath (**T.M**) is a small village near Benares, a town in the Northeastern part of India. It was known as *Migadāya* at the time of the Buddha. It was there that the Buddha preached Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta, etc., etc.

        (**T.M**) = " to elaborate OR to give details"
* The following unit B is a Unit of Elaboration with reference to A, for it is an elaboration of the word *Sarnath* mentioned in A.
Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Summarized Content with reference to B.
1. 
   - A. The whole family is busy.
   - B. Father (**T.M**) is mowing the lawn. Mother is preparing the dinner. The son is sweeping the floor. The daughter is cleaning the cupboard.
   
        (**T.M**) = the same as above
* The following unit B is a Unit of Elaboration with reference to A, for it is an elaboration of the working of the family mentioned in A.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Summarized Content with reference to B.

## 2. [**Unit of Elaborated Content** *followed by* **Unit of Summarized Content**](# "vitthāravākya - saṅkhepavākya")
E.g. 
- A. The members of our group are John (a soldier), Robert (a programmer),
Mary (a housewife) . . . George (a student).
- B. We (**T.M**) have altogether 15 members of various professions and pursuits.

    (**T.M**) = " to sum up, to summarize"
* The following unit B is a Unit of Summarized Content with reference to A, for it is a summary of the description, given in A, of group members.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Elaborated Content with reference to B.

## 3. [**Unit of Vague Content** *followed by* **Unit of Illuminated Content**](# "apākaṭavākya - tappākaṭīkaraṇavākya")
E.g. 
- A. The couple came to town.
- B. Just (**T.M**) as birds come to a tree full of fruits for a good meal, they moved to town hoping for an easy and happy life.

    (**T.M**) = " to explain OR to make lucid"
* The following unit B is a Unit of Illuminated Content with reference to A, for it is an explanation of how that couple moved to town.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Vague Content with reference to B.
-----------------------
    Note: a simply exhaustive account is termed a Unit of Elaborated Content whereas the one given using similes or reasoning is called a Unit of Illuminated Content.
-----------------------

## 4. [**Unit of Doubtful Content** *followed by* **Unit of Confirming Content**](# "daḷhiyavākya - daḷhīkaraṇavākya")
E.g. 

1. 
   - A. He would have passed the examination if he really wished to do so.
   - B. The (**T.M**) saying goes, " When there’s a will, there’s a way."

        (**T.M**) = " it is true"

    The following unit B is a Unit of Confirming Content with reference to A, for it quotes a popular proverb to confirm the prospect of passing the examination.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Doubtful Content with reference to B.
2. 
   - A. He really wishes to pass the examination.
   - B. Even (**T.M**) in his sleep, he is dreaming of his lessons.
   - (The translation of the thematic marker is the same as above)

    The following unit B is a Unit of Confirming Content with reference to A, for it gives the circumstantial evidence to confirm that he really "wills" to pass the examination.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Doubtful Content with reference to B.

## 5. [**Unit of Main Content** *followed by* **Unit of Concluding Content**](# "nigamanīyavākya - nigamanavākya")

This pair is similar to that of [**Unit of Elaborated Content** *followed by* **Unit of Summarized Content**](# "vitthāravākya - saṅkhepavākya") but the **concluding part** of a topic or chapter or even a whole book is termed **Unit of Concluding Content** while the rest of the topic, etc. is labeled **Unit of Main Content**.

## 6. [**Unit of Premise (Cause)** *followed by* **Unit of Conclusion (Effect)**](# "kāraṇavākya - phalavākya")

    (**T.M**) = " It would imply that OR Thus"
    (**T. M**)=“那或许暗示OR因此”

The following unit B is a Unit of Convincing Implication with reference to A, for it gives the sense **which is implied provided** the fact given in **A is confirmed**, i.e., "If the majority of committee members were absent at the meeting" . 

以下单元B是关于A的一个令人信服的含意单元，因为它给出了**隐含的意思**，只要**A中的事实得到确认**，即“如果大多数委员缺席会议”

(Note that B is an **indirect verification** of A)
(请注意，B是对A的**间接证明**)

Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Confirmable Content with reference to B.
因此，A被称为参照B的合理单元。
---------------
**Note on different opinions**:
**注意这里有不同观点**：
- A given unit is labeled a **Unit of Convincing Implication if**:
- 给定的单元被标记为**具有令人信服的含义的单元，条件是**：
  - a. It is an **effect (conclusion)** of another unit, which is **itself the effect (conclusion)** of still another OR
  - a. 它是另一个单元的**效果(结论)**，(另一个单元)**本身**还是另一个OR的**效果(结论)**
  - b. It is a unit of **effect (conclusion)** that precedes its unit of **cause (premise)** —— it implies that a unit of **effect (conclusion)** is termed so only if it follows its respective unit of **cause (premise)**.
  - b. 它是**效果(结论)**单元并位于其**原因(前提)**的单元之前——这是在暗示，只有当这个单元跟随其本身的**原因(前提)**时，它才被称为**结果(结论)**

       (**T.M**) = " The blame here is"
       (**T. M**)=“这里的矛盾是”

The following unit B is a Unit of Destructive Implication with reference to A, for it gives the **improbable content implied provided** the fact given in **A** is **confirmed**, i.e.,
"If the subject is a bore" . 
下面的单元B是关于A的破绽，因为它给出了**不太可能的结论推导**是在**A**中所给出的事实得到**确认**，即，“如果这个门课程无聊”的这一前提下。

(Note that B is an **indirect negation** of A)
(请注意，B是A的**间接否定**)

Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Disputable Content with reference to B.
因此，A被称为参照B的不合理单元

**OR** . 
- A. The subject is not boring.
- A. 这们课并不枯燥。
- B. **Otherwise**, (**T.M**) there would be no one in the class.
- B. **否则**，(**T. M**)班上就没有人了

    (The translation of the **thematic marker** is the same as above)
    (**关系连词**译文同上)

The following unit B is a Unit of Destructive Implication with reference to A, for it
gives the **improbable content implied if** the fact given in A is **refuted**, i.e., "If the
subject is boring" . 

后面的单元B是关于A的破绽的单元，因为它给出了如果A中给出的事实被**驳斥**，即“如果主题很无聊”这一前提下能够**推导出的不合理的内容**。

(Note that here B is an **indirect confirmation** of A and that certain
words meaning " otherwise", i.e., *itarathā*, *aññathā*, are typical of such units)

(请注意，此处B是对A的**间接确认**，并且某些意思为“否则”的词，即*itarathā*, *aññathā*是此类单元的典型代表)

Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Disputable Content with reference to B.
因此，A被称为关于B的不确定内容单元。

- B. Here (**T.M**) it means "a public house".
- 这里(**T. M**)它的意思是“酒店”。

    (**T.M**) = "in particular, specially, especially"

    (**T. M**)=“特指，特定，特别”

The following unit B is a Unit of Particular Content with reference to A, for it gives the **particular sense**, which is **contextually** required, out of the possible ones given **in A**,  i.e., that of "a public house".

下面的单元B是关于A的特定内容的单元，因为它根据**上下文**的实际需要给出了**A中**的可能的含义中的的**特定意义**，即“酒店”的名称。
