# **Introduction to Thematic Units**(*Vākya & Vākyajotaka*)
## **Introduction**
There are two kinds of relations usually defined to analyze given Pali text, namely, *word-to-word* relations and *sentence-to-sentence* ones. The former is used to get the syntactic sense of a sentence and has been discussed in *Basic / Advanced Relational Grammar*. The latter is used to get the accurate picture of logical relations among sentences of a paragraph, a chapter or even a volume. This topic is an introduction to *sentence-to-sentence* relations.
## **Thematic Unit** (*Vākya*)
The Pali term *vākya* literally means "a sentence", i.e., a self-contained set of words, in which syntactic word-to-word relations can be properly defined without going out of the set. However, it means here an independent unit of content or subject matter, hence the term **thematic unit**. The **smallest thematic unit** is a **sentence** and each of them may combine to form larger ones --- with their extents ranging from **two or more sentences** up to **a whole paragraph or chapter**, or **even a whole volume**.
## **Thematic Markers** (*Vākyajotaka*s)
Many thematic units are marked by certain indeclinables, namely, *hi, ca,* or *pana*. They are usually placed **immediately after** the **initial words** of their respective sentences. In theory, they are similar to English conjunctions --- they are said to illuminate the thematic relations among *thematic units*. In practice, however, each of them is used to indicate almost all relations possible; it is almost impossible to rely on them when they are so overloaded.

The actual process is rather the reverse. A thematic marker is only a signal that indicates the necessity to analyze the thematic relation of its HOST unit to the PREVIOUS one. After the analysis has been finished and the relation found out, that relation is used to make a reasonable translation of the marker itself.
## **Essential Content** (*Piṇḍattha*)
The term **essential content** is used in contrast with the *literal* content.

For example, a simple sentence counting the Triple Gems as Buddha, Dhamma and Saṅgha is **literally different** from a whole chapter explaining them in detail one by one; but they are **essentially the same** in content. Why? Because the subject matter is the same, i.e., the Triple Gems.

The **essential content** of a thematic unit is related to that of its **previous** or **following one** in one of following three ways:
- a. Identity
- b. Cause / effect (premise / conclusion)
- c. ordinary connection.

## **Types of Thematic Units**
The type of a given **thematic unit** is defined in reference to its preceding and following ones. For instance, if a unit is an **elaboration** of the previous one but serves as one of **partial content** to the following one, it is termed as the unit of both elaboration and **partial content**. Accordingly, types of thematic units are usually given in pairs; in each pair, each member has its type defined in reference to another.

Depending on the relation of their **essential contents**, they are divided into three classes.

- A. Units of Identical Contents

  1. Unit of [Summarized Content](# "saṅkhepa vākya") followed by Unit of [Elaborated Content](# "vitthāra vākya")
  2. Unit of [Elaborated Content](# "vitthāra vākya") followed by Unit of [Summarized Content](# "saṅkhepa vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  3. Unit of [Vague Content](# "apākaṭa vākya") followed by Unit of [Illuminated Content](# "tappākaṭīkaraṇa vākya")
  4. Unit of [Doubtful Content](# "daḷhiya vākya待定") followed by Unit of [Confirming Content](# "daḷhīkaraṇa vākya确定")
  5. Unit of [Main Content](# "nigamanīya vākya") followed by Unit of [Concluding Content](# "nigamana vākya")
- B. Units of Cause and Effect
 
  1. Unit of [Premise (Cause)](# "kāraṇa vākya") followed by Unit of [Conclusion (Effect)](# "phala vākya")
  2. Unit of [Conclusion (Effect)](# "phala vākya") followed by Unit of [Premise (Cause)](# "kāraṇa vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  3. Unit of [Confirmable Content](# "yutti vākya") followed by Unit of [Convincing Implication](# "laddhaguṇa vākya")
  4. Unit of [Disputable Content](# "ayutti vākya") followed by Unit of [Destructive Implication](# "laddhadosa vākya")
- C. Units of Ordinary Connection

  1.   Unit of [Partial Content](# "āraddha vākya") followed by Unit of [Continued Supplement](# "upanyāsa vākya")
  2.   Unit of [Partial Content](# "āraddha vākya") followed by Unit of [Resumed Supplement](# "vākyārambha vākya")
  3.   Unit of [General Content](# "sāmañña vākya") followed by Unit of [Particular Content](# "visesa vākya")
  4.   Unit of [Particular Content](# "visesa vākya") followed by Unit of [General Content](# "sāmañña vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  5.  Unit of [Affirmative Content](# "anvaya vākya") followed by Unit of [Negative Content](# "byatireka vākya")
  6.  Unit of [Negative Content](# "byatireka vākya") followed by Unit of [Affirmative Content](# "anvaya vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  7.  Unit of [Disapproved Content](# "garahā vākya") followed by Unit of [Commended Content](# "sambhāvanā vākya")
  8.  Unit of [Commended Content](# "sambhāvanā vākya") followed by Unit of [Disapproved Content](# "garahā vākya") (the pair above reversed)
  9.  Unit of [Previous Theme](# "pakkha vākya") followed by Unit of [Next Theme](# "pakkhantara vākya")

## **Usage of Thematic Markers**
1. All three markers, i.e., *hi*, *ca*, *pana*, can be placed in the **respective subsequent units** of all pairs **except the last three** to illuminate the relation of the **host** unit to the **previous** one.
2. Only *pana* can be used with the **subsequent** units of the **last three**, that is, with those of the 16th, 17th, and 18th.

## **Examples and Explanations of Thematic Units**
**Note:** In each example below, a potential thematic marker is marked as (**T.M**) and placed as the second word in the subsequent unit. And its translation is also given.

## 1. [**Unit of Summarized Content** *followed by* **Unit of Elaborated Content**](# "saṅkhepavākya - vitthāravākya")

E.g.

1. 
   - A. The couple lived at Sarnath.
   - B. Sarnath (**T.M**) is a small village near Benares, a town in the Northeastern part of India. It was known as *Migadāya* at the time of the Buddha. It was there that the Buddha preached Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta, etc., etc.

        (**T.M**) = " to elaborate OR to give details"
* The following unit B is a Unit of Elaboration with reference to A, for it is an elaboration of the word *Sarnath* mentioned in A.
Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Summarized Content with reference to B.
1. 
   - A. The whole family is busy.
   - B. Father (**T.M**) is mowing the lawn. Mother is preparing the dinner. The son is sweeping the floor. The daughter is cleaning the cupboard.
   
        (**T.M**) = the same as above
* The following unit B is a Unit of Elaboration with reference to A, for it is an elaboration of the working of the family mentioned in A.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Summarized Content with reference to B.

## 2. [**Unit of Elaborated Content** *followed by* **Unit of Summarized Content**](# "vitthāravākya - saṅkhepavākya")
E.g. 
- A. The members of our group are John (a soldier), Robert (a programmer),
Mary (a housewife) . . . George (a student).
- B. We (**T.M**) have altogether 15 members of various professions and pursuits.

    (**T.M**) = " to sum up, to summarize"
* The following unit B is a Unit of Summarized Content with reference to A, for it is a summary of the description, given in A, of group members.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Elaborated Content with reference to B.

## 3. [**Unit of Vague Content** *followed by* **Unit of Illuminated Content**](# "apākaṭavākya - tappākaṭīkaraṇavākya")
E.g. 
- A. The couple came to town.
- B. Just (**T.M**) as birds come to a tree full of fruits for a good meal, they moved to town hoping for an easy and happy life.

    (**T.M**) = " to explain OR to make lucid"
* The following unit B is a Unit of Illuminated Content with reference to A, for it is an explanation of how that couple moved to town.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Vague Content with reference to B.
-----------------------
    Note: a simply exhaustive account is termed a Unit of Elaborated Content whereas the one given using similes or reasoning is called a Unit of Illuminated Content.
-----------------------

## 4. [**Unit of Doubtful Content** *followed by* **Unit of Confirming Content**](# "daḷhiyavākya - daḷhīkaraṇavākya")
E.g. 

1. 
   - A. He would have passed the examination if he really wished to do so.
   - B. The (**T.M**) saying goes, " When there’s a will, there’s a way."

        (**T.M**) = " it is true"

    The following unit B is a Unit of Confirming Content with reference to A, for it quotes a popular proverb to confirm the prospect of passing the examination.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Doubtful Content with reference to B.
2. 
   - A. He really wishes to pass the examination.
   - B. Even (**T.M**) in his sleep, he is dreaming of his lessons.
   - (The translation of the thematic marker is the same as above)

    The following unit B is a Unit of Confirming Content with reference to A, for it gives the circumstantial evidence to confirm that he really "wills" to pass the examination.

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Doubtful Content with reference to B.

## 5. [**Unit of Main Content** *followed by* **Unit of Concluding Content**](# "nigamanīyavākya - nigamanavākya")

This pair is similar to that of [**Unit of Elaborated Content** *followed by* **Unit of Summarized Content**](# "vitthāravākya - saṅkhepavākya") but the **concluding part** of a topic or chapter or even a whole book is termed **Unit of Concluding Content** while the rest of the topic, etc. is labeled **Unit of Main Content**.

## 6. [**Unit of Premise (Cause)** *followed by* **Unit of Conclusion (Effect)**](# "kāraṇavākya - phalavākya")
E.g. 

1. 
   - A. Smoke is seen on the mountain.
   - B. Fire (**T.M**) is on the mountain.

       (**T.M**) = " Therefore it is known that"

    The following unit B is a Unit of **Conclusion** with reference to A, for it is the conclusion of the **premise** given in A, i.e., "smoke being seen" .

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Premise with reference to B.
2. 
   - A. A fire started to burn in the forest.
   - B. Billows (**T.M**) of smoke rose into the sky.

       (**T.M**) = " Therefore"

    The following unit B is a Unit of Effect with reference to A, for it is the **effect** of the **cause** given in A, i.e., " a fire burning in the forest".

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Cause with reference to B.

## 7. [**Unit of Conclusion (Effect)** *followed by* **Unit of Premise (Cause)**](# "phalavākya - kāraṇavākya")

E.g. 

1. 
   - A. Fire is on the mountain.
   - B. Smoke (**T.M**) is seen on the mountain.

        (**T.M**) = " It is known because"

The following unit B is a Unit of Premise with reference to A, for it is the premise of the conclusion given in A, i.e., "Fire being on the mountain" .

Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Conclusion with reference to B.

2. 
   - A. Billows of smoke rose into the sky.
   - B. A fire (**T.M**) started to burn in the forest.
   (**T.M**) = " Because"

The following unit B is a Unit of Cause with reference to A, for it is the cause of the effect given in A, i.e., " Smoke rising into the sky".

Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Effect with reference to B.

## 8. [**Unit of Confirmable Content** *followed by* **Unit of Convincing Implication**](# "yuttivākya - laddhaguṇavākya")

E.g. 
  - A. They said that only one-third of the committee turned up for the meeting.
  - B. It (**T.M**) would be a reflection of the fact that the majority of committee members were against the new leader.

    (**T.M**) = " It would imply that OR Thus"

The following unit B is a Unit of Convincing Implication with reference to A, for it gives the sense **which is implied provided** the fact given in **A is confirmed**, i.e., "If the majority of committee members were absent at the meeting" . (Note that B is an **indirect verification** of A)

Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Confirmable Content with reference to B.

---------------
**Note on different opinions**:

A given unit is labeled a **Unit of Convincing Implication if**:
- a. It is an **effect (conclusion)** of another unit, which is **itself the effect (conclusion)** of still another OR
- b. It is a unit of **effect (conclusion)** that precedes its unit of **cause (premise)** —— it implies that a unit of **effect (conclusion)** is termed so only if it follows its respective unit of **cause (premise)**.
--------------------

## 9. [**Unit of Disputable Content** *followed by* **Unit of Destructive Implication**](# "ayuttivākya - laddhadosavākya")
E.g. 

1. 
   - A. The subject is said to be too boring for students.
   - B. If (**T.M**) it were really so, no one would attend the lecture. But the lecture-hall is full every day.

       (**T.M**) = " The blame here is"

The following unit B is a Unit of Destructive Implication with reference to A, for it gives the improbable content implied provided the fact given in A is confirmed, i.e.,
"If the subject is a bore" . (Note that B is an indirect negation of A)

Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Disputable Content with reference to B.

OR . 
- A. The subject is not boring.
- B. Otherwise, (T.M) there would be no one in the class.
(The translation of the thematic marker is the same as above)
The following unit B is a Unit of Destructive Implication with reference to A, for it
gives the improbable content implied if the fact given in A is refuted, i.e., "If the
subject is boring" . (Note that here B is an indirect confirmation of A and that certain
words meaning " otherwise", i.e., itarathā, aññathā, are typical of such units)
Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Disputable Content with reference to B.
